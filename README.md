Quran Windows is a free, open source Quran application for Windows (Windows Phone 7, Windows Phone 8, Windows 10, and Windows 10 Mobile) based on Quran Android project (http://android.quran.com/).

Quran Windows provides the following features in the current version:

  * crystal clear Madani compliant images.
  * beautiful and smooth page transition effect.
  * landscape mode for even larger fonts and more comfortable image viewing.
  * bookmarking of an unlimited number of pages (tap the screen to find the bookmark button).
  * audio recitations with highlighting support

Because Quran Windows is an open source project, it makes it easy for anyone to [contribute](https://github.com/stankovski/quran-phone/pulls) and help improve the project. We are also open to hearing your [suggestions](https://github.com/stankovski/quran-phone/issues) to make Quran Windows the best Quran application on the market.
